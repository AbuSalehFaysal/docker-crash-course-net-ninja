# This repository will have the summary of whatever I learn from the playlist name "Docker Crash Course Tutorial" from "The Net Ninja"

# Lesson-01 - What is Docker
# We need a specific environment to run a specific project. Sometimes we need to share our project with other developers as well and they need to setup the specific environment to run that particular project. To make this process more efficient, docker comes up with a solution called docker container. In a container, we can put all the things to create a specific environment, and share the container with the other developers as well. In this way, the other developers do not have to spend ample amount of time setting up the environment. The only need to have docker to manage that container.
